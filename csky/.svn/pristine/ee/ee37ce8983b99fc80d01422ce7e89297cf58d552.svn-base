This is just an ongoing reminder of the things I'm currently checking out and why.

SwiftBAT sensdisc for all weights:
  - Check if weighting is at least reasonable in comparison (dist weight best)

WHSP Blazar sensdisc:
  - If worse in same way as Starburst, it's a weight or number of sources issue.
  - If good agreement, its a data problem (shouldn't use npz for other anlyses)

Mimic coenders binning scheme:
  - Just to see how temperamental this stuff is to the binning
  - Try WHSP sensdisc again both wys - shows temperamental for one catalog specifically

Implement my own pullcorrected data:
  - Should do for 4yr and 1yr anyway - can compare
  - Improve my 4yr curves?

Check per source / per year weights for SNR_noPWN
  - To confirm with Tessa
