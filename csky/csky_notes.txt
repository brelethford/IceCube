This txtfile is specifically to give dev notes for Mike when I encounter anything in csky that's vague or something I don't understand.


trials.py:
  
   PSTrialRunner.[every_function] - Needs docstrings (TRUTH,logevery, etc. - can use the same stuff from later functions)
                                  - differences between functions unclear through names, needs explicit defining (e.g. get_one_ts vs. get_one_ts_ns_gamma)
