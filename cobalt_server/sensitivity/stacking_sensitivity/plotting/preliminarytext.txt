Remember to use the following for plots that haven't been cleared by IceCube yet.

def ic_prelim(fig, x = 0.75, y = 0.8, **kw):
    """Marks maps and plots as preliminary"""
    if 'color' not in kw:
        kw['color'] = 'red'
    if 'weight' not in kw:
        kw['weight'] = 'bold'
    fig.text(x, y, "IceCube Preliminary", **kw)
